# Logo-Machine

For this challange I used JavaScrpt and node.js to make a Logo generator that allows users to generate simple logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. 
One issue I ran into was with my package.json. I fixed this issue by running "npm init -y" into my command line and then running "npm install".
Another issue I encountered was my image logo not showing up in my browser so I installed a SVG image converter.

# Usage 
When the user types "node index.js" into the command line it then prompts the user to enter a shape (circle, triangle, square). 
After the user chooses their shape it then prompts the user to pick a shape color.
When shape color is chosen, a logo.svg file is generated with code for the logo with the color and shape the user picked.
